# CS-320

I ensure that my code is functional and secure by writing one line at a time and compiling to verify that no errors are present. I use tools such as the Maven dependency check to see what my vulnerabilities are and how to mitigate them. User needs are what dictate the program that I'm writing. I approach designing software by first figuring out the project requirements through a series of interviews with the client. Each requirement becomes a use case that I then turn into a function within the application.
